# KtaneMissionUtil
A utility made to help create missions for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.


NOTE: This is currently unfinished. While it works(tm), there are still kinks to be ironed out and ideas to be implemented. Feel free to reach out with bug reports or ideas to blvdbroken on Discord.

Currently, this repository only has one file, a python file with a script that will open a GUI, but I plan to add a functioning exe soon.

When making a file with this, it creates a .asset file. Drag this file into the Assets\Missions folder in your mission pack Unity file, and Unity should automatically update with the mission.

If it's showing up as blank, try removing the description, that causes issues for some people on the current build.
