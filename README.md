# KtaneMissionUtil
A utility made to help create missions for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.


NOTE: This is currently unfinished. While it works(tm), there are still kinks to be ironed out and ideas to be implemented. Feel free to reach out with bug reports or ideas to Norville Rogers#1633 on Discord.

Currently, this repository only has one file, a python file with a script that will open a GUI, but I plan to add a functioning exe soon.
